		<p> "Bro culture is a subculture of young men and adults who spend time partying with others like themselves. Although the popular image of bro lifestyle is associated with sports apparel and fraternities, it lacks a consistent definition." -Wikipedia

	<h1>History</h1> 
			<br>
			<p> 
    Bro was originally an abbreviated form of "bruh" but began to assume non-familial connotations in the 20th century. In this evolution, it was first used to refer to another man, such as a "guy" or "fellow". In these ways, it was semantically similar to the use of "brother". In the 1970s, bro came to refer to a male friend rather than just another friend. The word became associated with young men who spend time partying with others like themselves. Oxford Dictionaries identified the use of the term "bro" as the one "defining feature" of the changing cultural attributes of young manhood.
